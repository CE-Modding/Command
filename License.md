   - Share Alike - If you adapt, or build upon this material, you may distribute the resulting material only under the same license.

## Furthermore: 

- You **MUST** attribute myself (The Creator/Source) on any/all modifications which inherit some or wholey the content that I have created.
   - This applies to both this GitHub **AND** my Steam Workshop. 

- You **MUST** retain any/all supplied licenses and supporting documents. 

- You **MUST** provide a link to the original source as part of any description(s).
   - _Original source being this repository OR the Steam Workshop page_.

- You **MUST** acknowledge that I reserve the right to deny the use of any of my creations at any time.
   - _This includes the revoking of past permissions, should I feel the need to do so_.
     
- You **MUST NOT** open or modify the provided PBO files in my mod(s). (You can freely modify, via class inheritance contained within your own mod(s)).
   - Should you wish to build upon the material, you can submit an [Issue](https://github.com/Eagle-Studios/CE_Mods/issues/new) on this Github.
      - Ensure you include what you wish to be added, as well as any necessary links/files that you wish to be included (Example: You wish to add a texture to my [Naval](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3382844451) mod).

- You **CANNOT** reupload my PBO files (You **MUST** add my mod(s) as a requiredAddon only), following the other terms of this licence. 

## Additionally

### Any mods published via this repository OR my Steam Workshop page **ARE NOT** to be used by any of the following;

   - Life or other Servers where my mod files are intended to be used behind a pay/donation wall
      - Life or other Servers can **ONLY** use my files where they are available for everyone to use (Having them behind a role I.E Coast Guard, is fine, providing you are not asking for money in order to be that role). 

   - Any servers that are used to depict current world conflicts (aka the Current Wars in: Ukraine & Gaza)


## Finally:

### Units listed here in this section have an outright refusal to use of any of my mods uploaded here **OR** on my steam workshop page **OR** any files that I have previously allowed you to use. 
_This ban is in place as usually you have violated my trust by removing or changing mod/license files to remove any mention of myself AND make it appear like you own the mods, therefore I have no choice except to outright refuse you to use them._

---------------
**The Canadian Tactical Group aka CTG:**

   - This includes members of this group uploading their own modifications, regardless of their intentions to not use it for this unit.
   - This also refuses this group, or any of its members from using ANY other files that I personally created and allowed you to use.

---------------
**Any Unit that use some or part of some illegal mods (Like TFL/Taxer/Hyun/etc/etc)**
   - You know exactly  what mods I am referring to.. ANY mod that has been ripped is included as part of this.
